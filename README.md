# Final project for Mathematics for Imaging and Signal Processing course 📶
<br/>
In this project the aim was to produce image deconvolution with Tikhonov regularization.<br/>

___

<br/>
The crucial points were:
<br/>
📍Convolving the image with a point spread function kernel (Gaussian, motion blur, diffraction limited or out of focus)<br/>
📍Tranforming the image to the Fourier domain and applying deconvolution<br/>
📍Recounstruct the image with Inverse Fourier Transform<br/>

<br/>

___

<br/>
To understand the overall quality of the obtained image the peak-signal-to-noise ratio was computed<br/>
<br/>

___

<br/>
Bonus ⭐<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, we applied window functions (triangular, Bartlett, Hamming, Gaussian or Butterworth) before the deconvolution step to see if the results differed from before.<br/>
All the images reconstructed can be viewed in the python notebook 😸<br/>
